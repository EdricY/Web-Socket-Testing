# Web-Socket-Testing
My first experience with net code.
using [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws).

### To run:
In the project directory run 
```npm install ws```

run the .sh file and use `node` to run the .js file (2 separate processes).<br>
Using a web browser, navigate to the port identified in the .sh file (ex. `localhost:1234` or `ip-address:1235`).

## chat
A fun and simple chat server with some silly chat commands.
HTML injection included.

## set
A quick and dirty spinoff of the popular card game "[Set](https://www.setgame.com/set)".

## plat
Messing with real time position updating.
